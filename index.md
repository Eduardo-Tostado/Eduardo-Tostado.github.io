Hello, I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2026

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 6, Part 2
The blackjack lab was my favorite as it was connected to gambling. I also remember trying to determine how I should approach programming an ace because I couldâ€™ve gone about it in several ways, which felt unlike the labs before it.

* Lab 7, Part 2
This lab was difficult as I had to wrap my head around the logical operators. On top of that, each street case was different, so the days and times that overlapped were confusing at first. I struggled to read the lines, but after tracing the code, I felt confident writing them out.

* Lab 9, Part 1
This program taught me how to take the average of a list of numbers after taking out the maximum and minimum. Finding the maximum and minimum from user input was an interesting problem that I struggled to find. After a while, I figured it out and was proud so I felt this should be considered one of my favorites.
